# DS5220_Supervised_ML
Using shotgun metagenomics sequencing and known participant disease status, scientists can build classification models to predict disease status in patients. There is currently little understanding of a “healthy” or
“ideal” gut microbiome. Building deeper knowledge in this space can open a world of research and development and can aid in disease prediction, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment.

## Features
* Dataset included 1989 participants across 14 different studies, all of which provided a stool sample.
* Successfully created a binary classifier using XGBoost and Random Forest for predicting disease in participants.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python  
* **Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`
* **Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `plotly`
